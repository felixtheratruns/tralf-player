Currently trying to fix an issue with python to allow uploading
However viewing uploaded players currently works.

Install: 
git clone git@github.com:felixtheratruns/django-tralf-interface.git


Then run in django-tralf-interface/web_interface
python manage.py runserver

then go to:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/

login:
username: joel
password: joel

go to "Players" and click on any of the options to watch
